The package can be directly installed with command go if libLBFGS is
installed to standard locations. Otherwise, change the lines starting
with #cgo above

    import "C"

in lbfgs.go to

    #cgo LDFLAGS: -Lpath_to_lbfgs_lib -llbfgs
    #cgo CFLAGS: -Ipath_to_lbfgs_include

to let the compiler know your custom install location. For more
information, see [http://golang.org/cmd/cgo].
